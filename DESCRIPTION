Description: Automate the co-localization analysis of fluorescence microscopy 
  images. Selecting regions of interest, extract pixel intensities from 
  the image channels and calculate different co-localization statistics. The
  methods implemented in this package is based on Dunn et al. (2011) 
  <doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00462.2010>.
